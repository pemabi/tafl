    "# Tablut via Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "---\n",
    "The goal here is to construct an engine to play the historical Scandinavian game Tablut, using a tabula rasa Reinforcement Learning approach as developed by Alpha Zero. In this notebook I'll run through all of my code, starting with logic to play the game, then designing a model to provide move probabilities and positional assesment, then setting up a MCTS pipeline to the generate data to iteratively train the model.\n",

    "## Initial Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "__On Gameplay:__\n",
    "\n",
    "The first challenge is to create an engine that can play the game under the exact rules. This engine should be reasonably efficient, as the gameplay element is the most expensive in the pipeline. It should also be relatively straighforward so that I can call the important methods (finding moves, applying moves, checking for terminal state) in a practical way during MCTS. In fact, it should __only deal with the basic mechanics__. Every other element (logging, tracking, tensor assembly, etc) should be handled by the class methods that will run the game during our training pipeline. This way, we will be able to reuse our logic for playing the game and expanding our search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge is fairly straightforward, and I have already done this for my first 1D implementation. However, because I am using a more complex model, and am attempting to leverage CNNs, and am trying to do this with a sophisticated enough approach to justify sinking some compute units into game simulation and training, I want to use a more structured approach to considering input format. This brings us to the second challenge - identifying a reasonable representation of Tablut for our model and then implementing the translation of our gamestate into this image. \n",
    "\n",
    "__On Input:__\n",
    "\n",
    "The first element is straightforward and just comprises the information that we need to describe the position currently on the board. 4x 9x9 bitvectors does this for us, the first is set to 1 for WHITE else 0; the second encodes 1 for BLACK else 0; the third encodes 1 for the KING else 0; the fourth is less obvious, encoding the Castle square if it is empty with 1 else 0. However, this only gives us the game representation we were have if we had just walked up behind two players and glanced over the board - and unfortunately the state of this game (in a Markovian sense of 'state') is not accurately reflected only by piece positions. There are rules surrounding continuous repetitions. Unfortunately, these rules are murky and, worse, recently contested. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Unfortunate Foray into Repetition Rules in Tafl Games:__\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Aage Nielsen](http://aagenielsen.dk/historical_hnefatafl_rules.php) rules state that repetitions are not allowed and result in a loss for White. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a [leaflet](http://tafl.cyningstan.com/data-download/1012/copenhagen-hnefatafl-leaflet) written by Damian Walker, the rule for _Copenhagen Hneftatl_ states:\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "\"Perpetual repetition is illegal. If the board position is repeated three times, the player in control of the situation must find another move.\"\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "The [final post](http://aagenielsen.dk/hnefataflforum/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=112&start=10) in a spirited forum discussion about repetitions and vaguery in the Copenhagen rules ended:\n",
    "<blockquote>\n",
    "\"October 2020 Adam Bartley started a discussion with Mario Aluizo (\"casshern\") and myself about repetitions in Tafl, and we came to the conclusion that the repetitions rule can be simplified, so that repetitions are always a loss for white (the defenders).\n",
    "\n",
    "I searched the full archive ten years for games ending in black repetitions and found none.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repetitions being always a loss for white has also earlier been suggested by Ytreza, Nath, OdinHimself and Unhandyandy.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the repetitions rule will be:\n",
    "Rule 8: Any perpetual repetition results in a loss for white.\"\n",
    "</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "I am thankful for this clarification in the blog, as the wording *\"the player in control of the situation\"* gave me a shiver down my spine. So even though there is a lack of clarity here -what constitutes a *perpetual* repetition- I'll make my own interpretation for training which I think the forum mods would be incomfortable with, and copy chess's 3-fold repetition rule. Those guys knew what they were doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will follow the chess approach of 'counting' unique positons, most likely via Zobrist hashing to generate keys. Initially I thought to only track the last few moves and see if they were directly repetitive (two pieces moving back and forth across two squares), but this ignores the possibility of a multi-piece repetitive sequence. The issue with a chess-like approach is this could lead to losses for White in circumstances where the player could reasonably feel that she is 'sniffing out' an exit with long sequences of non-repetitive moves that circle back to the same positions. However, the piece mobility and space involved in the game, combined with the inherent asymmetry, makes me believe that the vast majority of repetition occurances would be short-sequence shuffles with the King or White, moving away from, or protecting against, capture by Black. In cases where White is 'in control of the situation', by which I read, 'is leading the repetitive sequence', they will hopefully avoid repetitive moves once the Neural Net learns the associated penalties. And the Monte Carlo Tree Search approach will penalize branches associated with these instances in any case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the vast majority of repetitions will be quickfire, I will store the previous 7 board positions and pass these into the model. Doing this will have the oddity of needing Black to 'accept' the draw by making the last repeated move to win, when the move-1 by White is essentially an invitation for Black to end the game so should strictly be the last move. I don't see an elegant way around this while keeping the engine resilient to multi-sequence repetitions. AlphaZero and Lc0 both used past board positions in part to flag repetiitions, and it may well help the model recognise patterns during training as suggested by Klein in Neural Networks for Chess. This topic has been dfiscussed at length on the Lc0 message boards in more online community spirited debate. In principle, I understand the skeptic's angle that the game state should be Markovian, 8 states alone are not garuanteed to capture the details of repetition, and MCTS should deal entirely with the issues of reptition avoidance / encouragement. However, some of the arguments laid out in favour of history planes are convincing enough, and one of the Lc0 devs made clear that history inclusion definitively improved performance in some observed cases. Additionally, when dealing with such deep networks, additional input planes are very cheap, so any information that will help the Network learn should certainly be included. For example, out of curiosity I constructed my initial model (pending change) with both (8, 9, 9) and (57, 9, 9) input shapes, and the number of trainiable parameters only increased from 3,309,044 to 3,365,492. Fascinating!\n",
    "\n",
    "__Returning to Input Format:__\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained above, we describe our board with a 4x 9x9 tensor. To encode repetitions, we'll add 2 more planes as repitition counters - the first will be all 1s if the position has already appeared at least once, and the second will be all 1s if the position has already appeared twice. The 7th plane will mark the player's turn - full of Zeros for Black and Ones for White. This gives us a (7, 9, 9) shape, which we will stack the previous 7 moves onto for a total of (56, 9, 9). I am still not sure that including history is the best move - clearly in practice this had led to improved performance, but it introduces complications (introducing a hash system, etc) that I have never dealt with before. Maybe that alone is good enough reason to try. One last thought that I'd had was including a plane of Board Edges, as they are special squares for win conditions. However, I think that there is a chance that this would 'overweigh' these areas of the board, and the approach of dilineating important areas as constants hasn't been used elsewhere that I can see. One common approach that I am adopting is the inclusion of a constant plane of 1s in the input - this will help the network distinguish the boundaries of the board during convolutions. This results in a final input shape of (57, 9, 9) as broken down in the image below:\n",

    "The first question is do I need to do this? I've already asked this above. Necessarily, no. But I want to avoid the issue of repetitions. However, does this mean that I will be generating thousands of keys for all the board states reached in a game? Assume a game takes 50 moves. Performing 100 iterations of MCTS every move, that means 5,000 dictionary entries. It's not ideal. But these will not all be stored at once. I'll iteratively create dictionaries for new MCTS searches, which means that only a max of 100 + moves played + 1. But they will all need to be hashed and queried x5000, and that's not nothing. \n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like the best way to hash boardstates for these types of games is [Zobrist Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zobrist_hashing#:~:text=Zobrist%20hashing%20is%20the%20first%20known%20instance%20of%20tabulation%20hashing,are%20either%20black%20or%20white.). With Zobrist Hashing, we should be able to incrementally update the hash with XOR operations, and avoid the expensive process of recalculating it from board position. I think that the main process of tracking the hash will be inside the Board object, so we will pass our ZobristHashing class in at Board instantiation. Also, we will adapt the apply_move method to update the stored hash value. To do this, we'll also need to know which pieces are captured so I can XOR out during the increment (this will require a quick refactor of what find_captures returns)."

    "## Model Architecture\n",
    "------\n",
    "While my opposed to my proof of concept iteration was entirely fully connected,Dense layers, I want to experiment with using CNNs here. I'm trying to closely follow [Leela's model architecture](https://lczero.org/dev/backend/nn/#fn:3), using a core residual tower with successive Squeeze and Excitation Layers. I've attached a model diagram showing the topology in more detail. There are two ouputs, the 'Policy Head', which outputs a probability distribution mapped to all possible moves, and the 'Value Head', which outputs an assessment of the positional score. Because a tanh activation function is applied, this score will be between -1 and 1, the closer to 1 the more confident that this is a winning posiiton for the player whose turn it is. This is the first time that I've tried to construct a model of this complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "__A note on policy output:__\n",
    "\n",
    "In my proof of concept model inspired by Klein's Hexapawn implementation, I used a flat distribution of all legal moves as my output. In that model, which was only comprised of fully connected layers, the tensor was then flattened and again fully connected to an output vector of the same size as the vector containing all possible moves. A softmax activation function was applied during the output layer. The index of the output vector corresponded to the index value of a valid move tuple, and the output value at every index represented the probability of the corresponding move being best. Of course, some moves are not legal in the input position, so these are masked out on return.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems that AlphaZero and Leela both looked at this approach, but went with a different direction. Moves were considered as possible moves from a square (piece independent). this is represented as 8 x 8 x 73 (8 x 8 for start squares on a chess board and 73 representing: 1. the 8 x 7 Queen moves of 'direction moved' x 'squares moved'; 2. the 8 Knight moves; 3. the 3 x 3 of 'pawn promotion move directions' x 'pawn underpromotions'. Initially, I wondered why they didn't encode this simply from every start square, with every possible legal move from that square, but the representation space ends up being significantly larger. In Leela, at least, the Policy Head convolves the tensor down in size to a tensor shape matching the 73x8x8 shape (actually 80x8x8 including zero-padding), and then flattens and maps the output vector to a flattened representation of the possible moves space (impossible moves are given the value of -1). The values of the legal moves in this moves space are themselves mapped to the indices of the flat legal moves vector containing moves recorded in a format that can be interpreted by the gameplay engine. I've included an example of what my output space looks like to help build an intuition here. AlphaZero mentioned in their paper that both approaches to output work, but that the multi-dimensional output space approach converges faster. It's my intuition that this approach avoids some potential information bottlenecks, and is a smoother transition for the model to learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had to spend a while researching the mapping process Leela uses, and the padding structure. The code for the mapping layer and a very helpful description can be found [here](https://github.com/LeelaChessZero/lc0/blob/master/src/neural/cuda/layers.cc). "

    "Encoding repetitions: could have flag that shows that a loss by repetition is possible, and then mark the square that would lead to repetition. This would only add 2 extra squares, but overengineering the feature? Also not sure how this would apply to black. Takes away from the simplicity and 'zero' nature. Might as well start adding flags when a win is immediately available etc. (though this isnt a bad idea for endgame situations in competitive play!)"
